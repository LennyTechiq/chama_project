# Advanced Algorithm Chama System

The Chama System is a web-based application built using Spring Boot, designed to facilitate the management of chamas (investment groups). It provides a platform for chama administrators and members to manage their group activities, contributions, and financial transactions efficiently.

## Features

- User Authentication and Authorization:
Users can sign up and log in to their accounts securely.
Role-based access control allows administrators to manage user roles and permissions.
- Group Management:
Administrators can create and manage multiple chamas.
Each chama has its own set of members, contribution cycles, and financial records.
- Contribution Tracking:
Administrators can track member contributions, view group financial reports, and manage contribution cycles.
- Financial Transactions:
Members can deposit and withdraw funds from their chama accounts.
